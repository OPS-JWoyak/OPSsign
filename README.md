# OPSsign
Edu-focused digital signage, from Orono Public Schools

## This solution consists of the following:
- Raspberry Pi 5's connected to TVs, setup on the "Video" VLAN
- a web template which is pushed out to the RPi's via our RDM app
- an updater script in RDM that handles updating the settings on the RPi's and copying the web template
- a Google slide deck which is tied to the specific site/location and built into the site-customized deployed template
